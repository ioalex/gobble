## About The Project

Gobble is an opinionated boilerplate for starting projects quickly.

Credits to [cferdinandi's gulp-boilerplate](https://github.com/cferdinandi/gulp-boilerplate) and [othneildrew's template](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template) for their documentation, as this README is heavily based on theirs (I have no clue how to write one! üôà).

## Features

- Renders [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) template files to HTML and plug data supplied from YAML front matter or JSON.
- Conducts static code analysis on and minifies HTML.
- Generates sourcemaps for [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) and compiles it to CSS.
- Minifies and autoprefixes CSS.
- Obfuscates, concatenates, minifies and generates sourcemaps for JavaScript.
- Optimises images, SVGs and fonts.
- Busts cache by using a unique file version identifier - solves browser caching issues.
- Watches for file changes, and automatically recompile build and reload webpages using BrowserSync.

## Uses

- Nunjucks - to modularise HTML allowing for reusability.
- SASS - to write clean, easy and less CSS.
- Gulp - to run tasks!
- Prettier - to quickly format files.
- ESLint - to find and fix JavaScript errors.
- [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) - to follow a mostly reasonable approach to JS.
- EditorConfig - to define coding styles for editors.
- .nvmrc - to lock down Node version to project.
- Lighthouse CI GitHub Actions Workflow - for automated web page audits.
- Dependabot - for automated dependency updates.

## Getting Started

A guide to get up and running... üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Prerequisites

Please ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for packages
- [Gulp CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cli) for running tasks
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for cloning this repository

### Installation

Clone the repository in your project folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/ioalex/gobble.git
```

### Quick Start

1. Navigate to your project directory.

   ```
   $ cd project-root
   ```

2. Clone this repository.

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/ioalex/gobble.git
   ```

3. Run npm install to install required files and dependencies - for a list see [package.json](https://github.com/ioalex/gobble/blob/master/package.json) & [package-lock.json](https://github.com/ioalex/gobble/blob/master/package-lock.json).
4. Once installation is complete, run `npm start` to quickly create your `src` folder structure.
5. Happy coding!

The `gulp build` command will build projects from source.
The `gulp watch` command will fire up a local development server and watch your files, re-building your project in response to changes, while also reloading the server.

## Usage
